## üöÄ 3 Simple Steps to Deploy

### Step 1: Redeploy Backend on Render ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT

Your backend deployment failed because Render was looking at the root `package.json` instead of `backend/`.

**I've fixed this!** Now you need to:

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://dashboard.render.com
   - Click on your backend service

2. **Update Configuration**
   - Click "Settings"
   - Under "Build & Deploy"
   - **Set Root Directory to:** `backend`
   - **Set Build Command:** (leave empty)
   - **Set Start Command:** `npm start`
   - Click "Save Changes"

3. **Verify Environment Variables** (should already be there)
   ```
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://Dfood_db:ZKVu30vgK03Hgajh@cluster0.ioqhxhx.mongodb.net/dfoods?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

   EMAIL_USER=abhishek020621@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=exwwyhovmqfzuvrg
   ADMIN_EMAIL=abhishek020621@gmail.com
   ```

4. **Manual Deploy**
   - Go to "Manual Deploy" tab
   - Click "Deploy latest commit"
   - Wait for it to complete (2-3 minutes)

5. **Copy Backend URL**
   - From your Render service page, copy the URL
   - Example: `https://dfoods-backend-xxxx.onrender.com`

### Step 2: Update Frontend on Vercel

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard

2. **Select Your Project**
   - Click on "dfood-project"

3. **Add Environment Variable**
   - Go to: Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Click "Add New"
   - Key: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
   - Value: `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/api` (use your actual Render URL)
   - Click "Save"

4. **Redeploy**
   - Go to: Deployments tab
   - Click "..." on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"

### Step 3: Test Everything

1. **Test Backend**
   - Visit: `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/api/health`
   - Should show: `{"status":"ok","db":"connected"}`

2. **Test Frontend**
   - Visit: https://dfood-project.vercel.app
   - Should load properly (not "Loading..." forever)

3. **Test Admin Login**
   - Go to: https://dfood-project.vercel.app/admin-login
   - Login with:
     - Email: `admin@dfoods.com`
     - Password: `admin123`

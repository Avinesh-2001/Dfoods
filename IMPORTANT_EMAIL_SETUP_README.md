## ⚡ Quick 5-Minute Setup

### What You Need:
1. A Gmail account (or any email provider)
2. 5 minutes of your time
3. That's it!

---

## 🚀 Setup Steps

### Step 1️⃣: Create `.env` file

Open your terminal/PowerShell and run:

```powershell
cd Dfood\backend
notepad .env
```

This will create and open a `.env` file.

---

### Step 2️⃣: Add Configuration

Copy and paste this into the `.env` file:

```env
# MongoDB Connection
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/dfood

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here_change_this_in_production

# Server Port
PORT=5000

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# 📧 Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password-here
ADMIN_EMAIL=abhishek020621@gmail.com
```

---

### Step 3️⃣: Get Gmail App Password

**Why App Password?** Google requires special passwords for apps to access Gmail securely.

**How to get it:**

1. **Go to Google Account Security:**
   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   
2. **Enable 2-Step Verification:**
   - Find "2-Step Verification" section
   - Click "Get started" and follow the steps
   - This is required for App Passwords

3. **Generate App Password:**
   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - You might need to sign in again
   - Select "Mail" and "Windows Computer" (or "Other (Custom name)")
   - Click "Generate"
   
4. **Copy the Password:**
   - You'll see a 16-character password like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
   - Copy it (you won't see it again!)

5. **Update `.env` file:**
   ```env
   EMAIL_USER=your-actual-gmail@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop     # Paste here, remove spaces!
   ADMIN_EMAIL=abhishek020621@gmail.com
   ```

6. **Save the file** (Ctrl+S in Notepad)

---

### Step 4️⃣: Restart Backend Server

```powershell
# If backend is already running, stop it (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
cd Dfood\backend
npm run dev
```

**Look for this message:**
```
✅ Email server is ready to send messages
```

If you see that, you're done! 🎉

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the Email System:

1. **Open your website:**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000/contact

2. **Fill out the form:**
   - Use YOUR real email address so you can test the acknowledgment

3. **Submit the form**

4. **Check the backend terminal:**
   You should see:
   ```
   ✅ Contact form saved to database: { name: 'Test', email: 'test@example.com' }
   ✅ Admin notification email sent
   ✅ User acknowledgment email sent
   ```

5. **Check your email:**
   - **Admin email** (abhishek020621@gmail.com) should receive a notification
   - **Your email** should receive a thank you acknowledgment

---

## ❌ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Email configuration error"
**Cause:** Invalid credentials or 2-Step Verification not enabled

**Fix:**
1. Make sure 2-Step Verification is ON in your Google Account
2. Generate a NEW App Password
3. Copy it correctly (no spaces!)
4. Restart backend

---

### Problem: "Invalid login" error
**Cause:** Using regular Gmail password instead of App Password

**Fix:**

---

### Problem: Emails not arriving
**Cause:** Usually in spam/junk folder

**Fix:**
1. Check spam/junk folder in both admin and user emails
2. Mark email as "Not Spam"

---

### Problem: Backend shows "Connection timeout"

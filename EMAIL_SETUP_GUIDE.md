## 🔧 Setup Required (5 Minutes)

You need to configure your email credentials in the backend `.env` file.

### Step 1: Create/Update `.env` File

Navigate to `Dfood/backend/` and create a `.env` file (if it doesn't exist):

```bash
cd Dfood/backend
```

Add these lines to your `.env` file:

```env
# Email Configuration for Contact Form
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password-here
ADMIN_EMAIL=abhishek020621@gmail.com
```

---

### Step 2: Get Gmail App Password

**For Gmail users (RECOMMENDED):**

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification:**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Find "2-Step Verification" and turn it ON

2. **Generate App Password:**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select "Mail" and "Windows Computer" (or "Other")
   - Click "Generate"
   - Copy the **16-character password** (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

3. **Update .env file:**
   ```env
   EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop    # (no spaces)
   ADMIN_EMAIL=abhishek020621@gmail.com
   ```

---

### Step 3: Alternative Email Providers

**For Outlook/Hotmail users:**

1. Open `Dfood/backend/config/emailConfig.js`
2. Change line 8 from:
   ```javascript
   service: 'gmail',
   ```
   to:
   ```javascript
   service: 'outlook',  // or 'hotmail'
   ```
3. Update `.env` with your Outlook credentials

**For Yahoo users:**
- Change `service: 'yahoo'` in `emailConfig.js`
- Use your Yahoo account password or app password

**For custom SMTP:**
```javascript
// Replace the transporter in emailConfig.js with:
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: 'smtp.your-provider.com',
  port: 587,
  secure: false, // true for 465, false for other ports
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD,
  },
});
```

---

### Step 4: Restart Backend Server

After updating `.env`, restart your backend:

```bash
# Stop the current backend (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
cd Dfood/backend
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
✅ Email server is ready to send messages
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

1. **Go to your website:** http://localhost:3000/contact
2. **Fill out the contact form** with a real email address
3. **Submit the form**
4. **Check the backend terminal** for logs:
   ```
   ✅ Contact form saved to database
   ✅ Admin notification email sent
   ✅ User acknowledgment email sent
   ```
5. **Check your email inbox:**
   - **Admin** (abhishek020621@gmail.com) should receive a notification
   - **User** (the email you entered) should receive an acknowledgment

## ❌ Troubleshooting

### "Email configuration error" on server start

**Problem:** Invalid credentials
**Solution:**
- Double-check `EMAIL_USER` is correct
- Ensure `EMAIL_PASSWORD` is the **App Password**, not your regular password
- Remove any spaces in the app password

### "Failed to send admin email: Invalid login"

**Problem:** 2-Step Verification not enabled or wrong password
**Solution:**
- Enable 2-Step Verification in Google Account
- Generate a NEW App Password
- Update `.env` with the new password

### Emails not arriving

**Problem:** Emails might be in spam/junk folder
**Solution:**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Mark the email as "Not Spam"
- Add the sender to your contacts

### "Connection timeout" error

**Problem:** Firewall or network blocking SMTP
**Solution:**
- Check your firewall settings
- Try a different network
- Use port 465 (SSL) instead of 587 (TLS)

## 📧 Email Templates

### Admin Notification Email
- **Subject:** 🔔 New Contact Form Submission from [Name]
- **Content:** Beautiful HTML with all contact details
- **Purpose:** Notify admin of new inquiries

### User Acknowledgment Email
- **Subject:** ✅ Thank you for contacting Dfoods!
- **Content:** Professional acknowledgment with branding
- **Purpose:** Confirm submission to the user

## 🔒 Security Notes

1. **Never commit `.env` to Git** - It's already in `.gitignore`
2. **Use App Passwords** - More secure than regular passwords
3. **Rotate passwords regularly** - Generate new app passwords periodically
4. **Keep admin email updated** - Change `ADMIN_EMAIL` if needed

---

## 📝 Current Configuration

- **Admin Email:** abhishek020621@gmail.com
- **Email Service:** Gmail (nodemailer)
- **Email Sending:** Asynchronous (non-blocking)
- **Error Handling:** Graceful (saves form even if email fails)

---

## 🎯 What Happens When Someone Submits Contact Form

1. ✅ Form data is saved to MongoDB
2. ✅ Response sent to user immediately (fast!)
3. 📧 Admin notification email sent in background
4. 📧 User acknowledgment email sent in background
5. 💾 Contact appears in Admin Dashboard instantly

**Even if emails fail to send, the contact form will still be saved and visible in the admin dashboard!**

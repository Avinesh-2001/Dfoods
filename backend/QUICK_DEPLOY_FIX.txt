# ⚡ QUICK FIX: Route Not Found

## The Problem
{"message": "Route not found"} = OAuth endpoint not deployed yet

## The Fix (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Deploy to Render

**If using Git (auto-deploy):**
```bash
git add backend/server.js
git commit -m "Add OAuth callback"
git push origin main
```
Wait 2-5 minutes for auto-deploy.

**OR Manual Deploy:**
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Select backend service
3. Click "Manual Deploy"
4. Wait for completion

### Step 2: Test Endpoint

Visit: https://dfoods.onrender.com/oauth2callback

Should see HTML page (not JSON error).

### Step 3: Try Authorization Again

Use the authorization URL - should work now!

---

## That's It!

After deployment, the OAuth flow will complete successfully.

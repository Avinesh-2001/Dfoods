# ⚡ QUICK FIX: Google Verification Warning

## The Warning
"Google hasn't verified this app" - This is normal for testing!

## How to Continue (2 Clicks)

1. Click **"Advanced"** (at the bottom of the page)
2. Click **"Go to Dfoods (unsafe)"** (or "Continue to Dfoods")

## That's It!

After clicking those two buttons, you'll see:
- Permission screen → Click "Allow"
- Redirected to your callback page
- Your refresh token will be displayed!

## Why This Happens

- Your app is in Testing mode
- It uses sensitive Gmail scope
- Google shows warning for security
- **It's safe** - you're the developer!

## For Production (Optional - Later)

To remove warning for all users:
- Publish app in Google Cloud Console
- Submit for verification (takes days)
- Once verified, warning disappears

**For now, just bypass it and continue!**
